# Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualizer

This is a simple web-based visualizer for Dijkstra's Algorithm, built using AI and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create a graph, add vertices and edges, and run Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths between vertices.

## Features

- **Add Vertices**: Add vertices to the graph by entering a vertex name.
- **Add Edges**: Add weighted edges between vertices.
- **Run Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Select a starting vertex and calculate the shortest path to all other vertices.
- **Get Shortest Distance**: Get the shortest distance between two selected vertices.
- **Graph Visualization**: Visualize the graph structure and its connections dynamically.

## How to Use

1. **Add Vertices**: 
   - Enter the name of a vertex (e.g., A, B, C) in the "Add Vertex Data" section and click the "Add Vertex" button.
   
2. **Add Edges**:
   - Enter the starting vertex, ending vertex, and the weight of the edge in the "Add Edge" section, then click the "Add Edge" button.
   
3. **Run Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
   - In the "Run Dijkstra's Algorithm" section, enter the starting vertex, and click the "Run Dijkstra" button to calculate the shortest paths from the selected vertex to all other vertices.
   
4. **Get Shortest Distance**:
   - Enter a source and destination vertex to find the shortest distance between them.

5. **Graph Visualization**:
   - The graph will be visually represented in the "Graph Visualization" section with nodes and weighted edges.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dijkstra-visualizer.git
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser to start using the visualizer.
